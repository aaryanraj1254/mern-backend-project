Let's break down the code in register.js step by step:

Importing modules

The code starts by importing three modules:

mongoose: a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for MongoDB
bcryptjs: a library for hashing and salting passwords
jsonwebtoken: a library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
Defining the employee schema

The code defines a Mongoose schema for an employee document. The schema has several fields:

firstname, lastname, email, gender, phone, age: these are all required fields with specific data types (e.g., String, Number, etc.)
password and confirmpassword: these are required fields for storing the employee's password and confirmed password
tokens: an array of objects, where each object contains a single field token of type String
Generating tokens

The code defines a method generateAuthToken on the employeeSchema. This method generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) using the jsonwebtoken library. Here's what happens:

The method takes no arguments and returns a promise.
It uses the jwt.sign() function to generate a token, passing in the employee's _id field as the payload and a secret key ("mynameisaaryan").
The generated token is then added to the tokens array of the employee document.
The method saves the updated employee document using await this.save().
The generated token is returned as a string.
Hashing passwords

The code defines a pre-save hook using employeeSchema.pre("save", ...) to hash the employee's password before saving the document. Here's what happens:

The hook checks if the password field has been modified (i.e., if the employee is creating a new account or updating their password).
If the password has been modified, the hook uses bcrypt.hash() to hash the password with a salt of 10 rounds.
The hashed password is then stored in both the password and confirmpassword fields.
The hook calls next() to continue with the save operation.
Creating the Register model

Finally, the code creates a Mongoose model called Register using the employeeSchema. This model can be used to interact with the employees collection in the MongoDB database.

In summary, this code defines a Mongoose schema for an employee document, generates JSON Web Tokens for authentication, and hashes passwords using bcrypt.
